                                1. Valid submission: only problems where a valid submission is made will be eligible for rewards. This means the submission was:
                                within the valid time period for that problem; this is before 23:59 PM PT on the day it appeared.
                                made within this Explore Card. If you have completed the question previously, you will need to re-submit an answer within this Explore Card.
                                given the judgement "Accepted" when submitted. Please note that if your submission receives a different judgement, including, but not limited to, Wrong Answer or Time Limit Exceeded, you are allowed to resubmit, as long as it's still within the valid time period.
                                After making a valid submission for a problem, a blue checkmark will appear next to that problem in the left bar. A grey cross means that a valid submission was not made on time for that problem, and so, unfortunately, you're no longer eligible for prizes for that problem.

                            2. Late or invalid submissions: will not be accepted under any circumstances. It is your responsibility to make a valid submission for a problem within its valid time period, and to confirm that the blue checkmark has appeared.
